# Wikipedia Redirect

This browser extension automatically detects interlanguage links on
Wikipedia and redirects you to the English version of an article (which
is typically of much higher quality) if you land on a non-English
version.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Enable developer mode in `chrome://extensions`
3. Load the directory as an unpacked extension (see [Load an unpacked
   extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked))
